<h1>Prefetch</h1>

<p>With barba.js we can start prefetching the new page on the user's mouseover/touchstart on the link.</p>

<p>Since there is a 100-300ms delay during the user hover and the click, we can use this time to start prefetching the page. Most of the time this dead time is enough to get the next page ready!</p>

<p>Enable it calling:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
Barba.Prefetch.init();
{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote>
  <p>Be wise with the prefetching. Do not use it if you have a long list of links.</p>
</blockquote>
