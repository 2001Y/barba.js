<h1>Cache</h1>

<p>By default barba.js uses a simple cache to save pages. By doing so, if the user navigates to a page already visited, there will be no xhr call.</p>

<p>You can manually access the cache through the object <code>Barba.Pjax.Cache</code> or disable it setting by <code>Barba.Pjax.cacheEnabled</code> as <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>The actual cache is a plain JavaScript obejct, and it's destroyed at the user's browser refresh.</p>

<p>In the future it is planned to create a more permanent cache based on <code>LocalStorage</code> with an expiration.</p>
