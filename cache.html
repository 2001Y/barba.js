<h1>Cache</h1>

<p>By default barba.js uses a simple Cache to save pages, in this way if the user navigates to a page already visited, there will be no xhr call.</p>

<p>You can manually access to the cache through the object <code>Barba.Pjax.Cache</code> or disable it setting <code>Barba.Pjax.cacheEnabled</code> as <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>The actual Cache is a plain JavaScript obejct, and it's destroyed at the user's browser refresh.</p>

<p>In the future it is also planned to create a more permanent cache based on <code>LocalStorage</code> with expire.</p>
