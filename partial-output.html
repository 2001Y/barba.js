  <div class="barba-container">
    <h1>Partial Output</h1>
    <p>Barba.js sends a custom HTTP Header <code>x-barba</code> in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>
    <p>If you are using a server side language, you could detect this custom HTTP Header and output just the container instead of the entire page.</p>
    <p>This could result in less bandwith usage and less server-side load.</p>

      <p>Please note: doing so, you have to handle manually the upate of the title of the page.</p>
